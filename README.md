# Java Programs Repository

Welcome to the **Java Programs** repository! This repository contains a collection of Java programs that cover various concepts in Java programming, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview
This repository is designed to help beginners and experienced Java developers enhance their programming skills. It includes solutions to common programming problems, practice exercises, and fundamental Java concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
The repository is structured into different categories based on the type of programs:
- **Basic Programs**: Simple Java programs covering basic syntax and operations.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Programs demonstrating OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion, and other fundamental algorithms.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Programs demonstrating multi-threading, file handling, exception handling, and more.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or later).
- Install an IDE like [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for a better coding experience.
